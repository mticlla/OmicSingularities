# OmicSingularities
A set of recipies to build Singularity containers for analysis of omic data. In addition, pre-built containers with these recipies can be downloaded from SingularityHub

- [**Pre-processing QC (preQC)**](https://github.com/mticlla/OmicSingularities/tree/master/preQC): a containerized environment with software for quality control and preprocessing of sequencing data. Resulting image is built with CentOS 7 as base OS and Python 3.6. Although this is a companion container of the MetagenomicSnake workflow, it can also be used separately.
- [**meta16S**](https://github.com/mticlla/OmicSingularities/tree/master/meta16S) : a containerized environment for 16S-rRNA-gene sequencing data analysis with QIIME2.
- [**MetaProf**](https://github.com/mticlla/OmicSingularities/blob/master/metaProf/README.md): a containerized/singularized environment for taxonomic and functional profiling of metagenomic shotgun data.
